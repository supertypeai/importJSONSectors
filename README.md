# importJSONSectors
This repository contains the Apps Script code for the financial analytics workshop. This script is modified based on the original [importJSON.gs](https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON).
To use go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script` and paste the whole `ImportJSONSectors.gs` file.

Don't forget to add your `Sectors API Key` as `API_KEY` to `Project Settings` > `Script Properties`.

Here are all the functions available:
